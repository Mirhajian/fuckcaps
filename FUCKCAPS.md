# FUCKCAPS

FUCK CAPS LOCK! This is my expression when I see that pesky key on my keyboard. It’s just a silly way to capitalize characters and a total waste of a button! If you’re reading this, it probably means you’ve stumbled upon an exact problem, and let me tell you, multitasking is causing me actual pain.

I don’t know if this idea exists, but I’m not Googling it—don’t want to ruin my imagination! I want to create something new and unique. Of course, it’s not going to be perfect; there will be bugs and stuff. But hey, I’ll do my best!

In my early thoughts, I’m considering switching between two modes: **action mode** and **normal mode**. Yeah, kinda just like Vim, but hear me out! How many times has your lazy self wished for an easier way to press a difficult combination like: **Command + Control + Shift + 3** just to take a screenshot on a Mac? Well, I do one better: I use **Yabai** to multitask on my Mac. It’s a great tool, but switching between desktops with **Control + Left/Right arrow keys**? Painful! It’s like stretching your pinkie to the edge of the universe and then putting it back. Ouch!

So, I ask myself: what if there was another mode where you could apply commands with a single button—without sending your pinkies on a cross-country trip? What if I pressed **Caps Lock** and suddenly it transformed into a different mode? In this mode, pressing **H, J, K,** and **L** would map to the arrow keys. Now that would be a game changer—especially for those of us using a **60% keyboard**! or you could record a macro and set it for a key. imagine you press the **S** and it automatically takes a screenshot!

With 60% keyboards, you have to use combinations to access arrow keys. For me, that’s painful. If I want to move between windows, I have to press **Fn + arrow key + Control** just to switch desktops. This could save my pinkies from a life of torment!
